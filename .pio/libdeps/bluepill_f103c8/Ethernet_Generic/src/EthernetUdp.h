  EthernetUdp.h

  Ethernet_Generic is a library for the W5x00 Ethernet shields trying to merge the good features of
  previous Ethernet libraries

  Based on and modified from

  1) Ethernet Library         https://github.com/arduino-libraries/Ethernet
  2) EthernetLarge Library    https://github.com/OPEnSLab-OSU/EthernetLarge
  3) Ethernet2 Library        https://github.com/adafruit/Ethernet2
  4) Ethernet3 Library        https://github.com/sstaub/Ethernet3

  Built by Khoi Hoang https://github.com/khoih-prog/EthernetWebServer

/*
    Udp.cpp: Library to send/receive UDP packets with the Arduino ethernet shield.
    This version only offers minimal wrapping of socket.cpp
    Drop Udp.h/.cpp into the Ethernet library directory at hardware/libraries/Ethernet/

   NOTE: UDP is fast, but has some important limitations (thanks to Warren Gray for mentioning these)
   1) UDP does not guarantee the order in which assembled UDP packets are received. This
   might not happen often in practice, but in larger network topologies, a UDP
   packet can be received out of sequence.
   2) UDP does not guard against lost packets - so packets *can* disappear without the sender being
   aware of it. Again, this may not be a concern in practice on small local networks.
